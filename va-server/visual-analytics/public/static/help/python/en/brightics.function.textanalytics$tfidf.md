## Description
This is a function to calculate TF-IDF, abbreviated term for term frequency-inverse document frequency.

## Properties
### VA
#### Inputs: table

#### Parameters
1. **Input Column**<b style="color:red">*</b>: Column to select as input
   - Allowed column type : String, String[]
2. **Maximum Document Frequency**: When building the vocabulary, ignore terms that have a document frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific stop words).
   - Value type : Integer
   - Default : the number of documents
3. **Minimum Document Frequency**: When building the vocabulary, ignore terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also called cut-off in the literature.
   - Value type : Integer
   - Default : 1 (value >= 0)
4. **Number of Vocabularies**: The number of vocabularies that will be utilized to count their frequencies in the entire documents. It should be greater than or equal to two.
   - Value type : Integer
   - Default : 1000 (value >= 2)
5. **IDF Weighting Scheme**: Weighting scheme for IDF. Currently it is providing "Unary" and "Inverse Document Frequency" only.
   - Available items
      - Unary
      - Inverse Document Frequency (default)
6. **Norm**: Norm used to normalize term vectors.
   - Available items
      - L1
      - L2 (default)
7. **Smooth IDF**: Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an extra document was seen containing every term in the collection exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.
8. **Sublinear TF**: Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace "tf" with "1 + log(tf)".
9. **Remove Zero Counts**: Delete zero counts.
10. **Group By**: Columns to group by
